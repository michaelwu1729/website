    <h1>Fixing the Money Structure in Professional Tennis</h1>
    <section id="preface">
      <h2> Preface </h2>
      <p>This video covers my (brief) research into the money structure that heavily favors those
      at the top, leaving very little for the (still extremely skilled) players outside the top 100,
      as well as a few brief proposals for potential solutions. </p>

      <p>This video was made as a Final project for CAT 125R at UCSD. Note that the intended audience
      for this video was the Board of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), people who are 
      extremely knowledgeable concerning the tournament and money structure currently in professional
      tennis. If you are unfamiliar with tennis tournaments or want to learn more about them, I 
      suggest visiting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour">this Wikipedia page</a> for
      a brief introduction on the ATP before watching the video.</p>
