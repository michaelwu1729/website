    <section id="intro">
      <p>Hello, and welcome to my page! I'm an undergraduate CS student at UCSD. In my free time you'll 
      find me out on the tennis court, <del> in the gym </del>, on Twitch, or critiquing boba shops
      across the Bay Area.</p>

    <section id="about-me">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      A few facts about me: <br />
      <b>Age</b>: 20 <br />
      <b>Hometown</b>: Bay Area, CA <br /> 
      <b>Favorite Food</b>: Pho <br />
      <b>Favorite TV show</b>: Brooklyn 99 <br />
      <b>Hobbies</b> (pre-pandemic, aside from coding): tennis, gym/exercising, video games <br />
      <b>Something not many people know about me</b>: I love listening to ASMR to help relax. I use it everyday as my way of meditating.

      <h2>My Work</h2>
      <p>Here are some links to my previous works (almost all of these are software endeavors;
      but you'll also find some non-software work I thought were cool enough to publish here)</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="files/Michael_Wu_Resume_W2021.pdf">My Resume</a></li>

      </ul>

      Some of my works are from class projects. I'm working on re-purposing the code to make them more user-interactive and to
      prevent any potential Academic Integrity violations. They'll be posted above once they're finished.
